title: Release Notes for v3.2

# Python-Markdown 3.2 Release Notes

Python-Markdown version 3.2 supports Python versions 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8,
PyPy and PyPy3.

## Backwards-incompatible changes

### Drop support for Python 2.7

Python 2.7 reaches end-of-life on 2020-01-01 and Python-Markdown 3.2 has dropped
support for it. Please upgrade to Python 3, or use Python-Markdown 3.1.

### `em` and `strong` inline processor changes

In order to fix issue #792, `em`/`strong` inline processors were refactored. This
translated into removing many of the existing inline processors that handled this
logic:

* `em_strong`
* `strong`
* `emphasis`
* `strong2`
* `emphasis`

These processors were replaced with two new ones:

* `em_strong`
* `em_strong2`

The [`legacy_em`](../extensions/legacy_em.md) extension was also modified with new,
refactored logic and simply overrides the `em_strong2` inline processor.

### CodeHilite now always wraps with `<code>` tags

Before, the HTML generated by CodeHilite looked like:
- `<pre><code>foo = 'bar'</code></pre>` if you **were not** using Pygments.
- `<pre>foo = 'bar'</pre>`  if you **were** using Pygments.

To make the cases more consistent (and adhere to many Markdown specifications and 
HTML code block markup suggestions), CodeHilite will now always additionally wrap
code with `<code>` tags. See #862 for more details.

This change does not alter the Python-Markdown API, but users relying on the old 
markup will find their output now changed.

Internally, this change relies on the Pygments 2.4, so you must be using at least
that version to see this effect. Users with earlier Pygments versions will
continue to see the old behavior.

## New features

The following new features have been included in the release:

* Markdown parsing in HTML has been exposed via a separate extension called
  [`md_in_html`](../extensions/md_in_html.md).

* Add support for Python 3.8.

## Bug fixes

The following bug fixes are included in the 3.2 release:

* Refactor bold and italic logic in order to solve complex nesting issues (#792).
* Always wrap CodeHilite code in <code> tags (#862).
